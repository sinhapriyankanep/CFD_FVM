# üå´Ô∏è 2D Advection-Diffusion of a Pollutant in a Rectangular Domain

This repository simulates the **steady-state spreading of a pollutant** in a 2D domain under a constant velocity field using the **advection-diffusion equation**. The pollutant is injected via a Gaussian profile at the left boundary, and its evolution is tracked until a steady-state solution is reached.

---

## üìò Problem Description

A rectangular domain of size:

\[
L_x \times L_y = 2 \times 1 \quad (\text{in arbitrary units})
\]

is filled with a fluid of constant diffusivity \( D \). A pollutant is introduced from the left boundary \( (x = 0) \) with a **Gaussian concentration profile**, and is carried through the domain by a constant velocity field \( (u, v) \).

---

### üßÆ Governing Equation

The **2D steady-state advection-diffusion equation** is given by:

\[
u \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} = D \left( \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( C(x, y) \): concentration of the pollutant
- \( (u, v) \): velocity field components
- \( D \): diffusion coefficient

### ‚öôÔ∏è Boundary Conditions

- **Left boundary (x = 0)**: Dirichlet (Gaussian)
  
\[
C(0, y) = C_0 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(y - y_c)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\]

  where:
  - \( C_0 = 1 \): peak concentration
  - \( y_c = \frac{L_y}{2} \): vertical center
  - \( \sigma = \frac{L_y}{5} \): spread of the Gaussian

- **Right boundary (x = Lx)**: Neumann (zero gradient)
  
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = 0
\]

- **Top and bottom boundaries (y = 0 and y = Ly)**: Neumann (zero gradient)
  
\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial y} = 0
\]

---

### ‚è≥ Initial Condition

\[
C(x, y, t=0) = 0 \quad \forall x \in (0, L_x), y \in (0, L_y)
\]

## üõ†Ô∏è Numerical Method

The simulation uses:
- Finite difference discretization (central difference for diffusion, upwind for advection)
- Iterative time-stepping until convergence to a steady state
- Dirichlet and Neumann BC enforcement
